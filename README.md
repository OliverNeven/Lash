# Lash
A (close to) clone of the BASIC programming language.

Refer to the grammer.txt for syntax guidance.
The 'sample_code.lash' file will automatically be run when the program is executed. If you wish to run a filed parsed as an argument, simple set the 'SAMPLEFILE' boolean to 'false' inside Lash.java.

Still is still in early development and may not work 100% of the time.
